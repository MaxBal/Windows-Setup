- Turn off Windows Customer Experience mprovement Program -> Enabled
- Turn off downloading of print drivers over HTTP -> Enabled
Turn off printing over HTTP -> Enabled
- Turn off Help and Support Center "Did you know?" content -> Enabled (These are probably not that useful and will just be annoying)
- Turn off Windows Error Reporting -> Enabled
- turn off Search Companion content file updates -> Enabled
- Turn off Windows Messenger Customer Experience Improvement Program -> Enabled
