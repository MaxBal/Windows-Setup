# Legacy Microsoft Edge

`Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Microsoft Edge`

**Legacy Microsoft Edge, not the Chromium based one. Obsolete.**

- Configure Autofill -> Disable (Password Manager is off so no reason for autofill to be on)
- Configure Do Not Track -> Enable
- Allow Extensions -> Disable (I do not use extensions, and they reduce security in a lot of cases. Don't disable this if you need extensions, of course.)
- Allow Adobe Flash -> Disable (Dead technology, dangerous)
- Configure Password Manager -> Disable (**The password manager does NOT have E2EE**)
- Prevent using Localhost IP address for WebRTC -> Enable
