- Turn off display of recent search entries in the File Explorer search box -> Enabled (**EXTREMELY INVASIVE**. This stores your search history in the registry according to the docs, and is also responsible for the Bing search in the Start Menu just like the policies in Search even though the description does not mention it.)
