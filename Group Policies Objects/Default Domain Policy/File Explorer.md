# File Explorer

`Computer Configuration\Policies\Administrative Templates\Windows Components\File Explorer`

- Turn off account-based insights, recent, favorite, and recommended files in File Explorer -> Enabled (Not sure if this is actually privacy invasive or not, but best to keep it off anyways.)

`User Configuration\Policies\Administrative Templates\Windows Components\File Explorer`

- Turn off display of recent search entries in the File Explorer search box -> Enabled (**EXTREMELY INVASIVE**. This stores your search history in the registry according to the docs, and is also responsible for the Bing search in the Start Menu just like the policies in Search even though the description does not mention it.)
