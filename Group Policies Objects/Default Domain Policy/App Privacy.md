# App Privacy

`Computer Configuration\Policies\Administrative Templates\Windows Components\App Privacy`

These contains some settings that are not in the Settings app (and vice versa). Most of these stuff I will never use, therefore I am forcing them to be off. You do not need to follow me on this, but you should at least check out all of the policies there.
