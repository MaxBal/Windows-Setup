# Microsoft Edge

`Computer Configuration\Policies\Administrative Templates\Microsoft Edge`

You will need to download the Edge policies from https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/business/download?form=MA13FJ and install it.

SmartScreen and Typosquatting as recommeded settings doesn't seem to apply consistently, therefore I force them to be disabled in my Domain Default Policy.

Policies to set are documented at https://github.com/TommyTran732/Microsoft-Edge-Policies
