# Cloud Content

`Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Cloud Content`

I mostly disable all cloud content because they are way too annoying. There are also a few group policies relating to "personalization", so I am not entirely sure on the privacy implication of that either.

- Turn off cloud optimized content -> Enabled
- Turn off cloud consumer account state content -> Enabled
- Do not show Windows tips -> Enabled
- Turn of Microsoft consumer experiences -> Enabled
