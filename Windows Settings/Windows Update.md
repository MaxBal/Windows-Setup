# Windows Update

Make sure the followings are selected:

- Update as soon as possible
- Advanced option -> Recieve updates for other Microsoft products
- If using VMs, it's probably a good idea to toggle Get me up to date on, as they will fall behind quite frequently
- Notify when restart is required to finish updating
- Install optional updates
