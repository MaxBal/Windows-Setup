# Scripts

- Put these in your NETLOGON directory
- In group policy objects, select the object you want to edit -> Computer Configuration -> Windows Setings -> Scripts -> Startup -> PowerShell Script, and add the scripts you want to use. Personally, I use all of these scripts in my Default Domain Policy object.
